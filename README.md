# hello-world
One small step for a man, one giant step for mankind.
I am a web coder-turned-Product Manager who found an awesome business opportunity but didn't have funding to pursue it. So now that technologies have radically changed, I am learning full-stack javascript framworks, libraries, techniques and tools.  This will allow me to build an MVP application - perhaps with some assistance with developers who have experience with Meteor, React.js, React Native, SaSS, HTML5, MongoDB and Redux.

My mission is to:
  * Build software that is delightful to use, makes work easy, and empowers everyone whose activities are supported.
  * Become the first choice vendor for software in any industry.
  * Create opportunity and wealth for multitudes of people.
